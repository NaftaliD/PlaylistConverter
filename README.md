# PlaylistConverter

This is a little side learning project I am doing for myself.

This code takes playlists from different services and transforms them into others.

Currently, only YouTube and Spotify are implemented.
Might add others in the future.

# Running

The code is implemented to run with Gui using Streamlib but can be used in pure python like in main.py

To execute add develpor keys and Tokens to config.json from both YouTube and Spotify:

https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/

https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
